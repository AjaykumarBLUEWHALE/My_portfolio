<div>I played an indie game this week called Bloody Bastards, and I feel like it deserves way more attention than it gets. It’s been stuck in my head ever since I played it, and I really want to put my thoughts into words. This is a spoiler-free review, just me sharing what I loved about it.

  <h1 class="header-pro1">How it started</h1>

  <p>It’s Monday, and I’m not really in the mood to work on my usual projects. So, I decided to take a break and look for a mobile game that could keep me entertained for a while. As I was browsing through the Google Play Store, I came across a title that had caught my eye before but I never gave it a proper try — <strong>Bloody Bastards</strong>.</p>

  <blockquote>Indie physics-based sword fighting game</blockquote>

  <p>I had seen it a couple of times before but didn’t pay much attention. This time, the brutal 2D visuals and medieval theme pulled me in. It looked chaotic, raw, and fun — and that’s exactly what I needed. So I downloaded it, expecting just a quick distraction, but ended up getting much more than that.</p>

  <p><strong>Bloody Bastards</strong> is a physics-based fighting game by Tibith, and it's one of those rare indie games that stands out with its unique mechanics and style. It's fast, violent, and weirdly hilarious.</p>

  <p><em>"Like Stick Fight meets Dark Souls"</em> – That’s how I’d describe it if I had to explain it to someone in a sentence. But don’t let that oversimplify it. The game has depth, challenge, and a surprising amount of strategy once you get into it.</p>

  <p>What really grabbed me was the sheer madness of the combat. You control your fighter’s arms individually, using your thumbs to swing weapons, block, and bash enemies in the most ridiculous physics-based brawls you can imagine. It looks messy — because it is — but that’s what makes it addictive. The battles are tense and hilarious at the same time, and every win feels earned, especially when you're getting beat down in chainmail and sandals.</p>

  <h1 class="header-pro1">Going into the Arena</h1>

  <p>The creator of Bloody Bastards doesn’t need a long introduction — the game speaks for itself the moment you start swinging your first sword. But if I had to describe it simply, I’d say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "A chaotic physics-based fighting game where you battle your way through medieval madness using only your thumbs and your wits."
  </blockquote>

  <p>At first glance, the game might seem a bit wild and unpolished, but that’s exactly what gives it character. It throws you straight into brutal 1v1 fights with ragdoll-style controls and absolutely no mercy. You can jump into battle quickly, but you’ll soon find there’s more to it — dozens of weapons, gear combinations, and a stamina system that makes every move matter.</p>

  <p>The arenas are simple but effective. What stands out is not the background, but how the mechanics play out. Each hit feels raw. Each fight feels unpredictable. There’s no scripted animation — it's just you, your awkwardly swinging arms, and whatever brutal tool you’ve equipped. And somehow, that makes it more satisfying than most polished fighting games.</p>

  <p>If you stick around longer, you start to notice the clever design behind the chaos. The controls might seem ridiculous at first, but there’s real skill to be developed. Timing, balance, gear weight, stamina usage — it all adds up. And with the constant updates and new content, the game keeps evolving.</p>

  <p>One little detail I really appreciated? Your fighter actually grunts and reacts in hilarious ways during battle. It adds a weirdly personal touch to the carnage. You’re not just some silent dummy swinging at air — you’re a battered bastard trying to survive.</p>

  <p>I also want to mention something I personally experienced while playing the game. The graphics are incredibly brutal — definitely 13+ — and honestly, surprisingly good for a 2D title. Every time I struck an opponent, the vibration through the device felt so real that it hit me in the head — like I was the one delivering the blow. It gave me a weirdly immersive, almost 3D-like experience, and I’ve never felt anything like that from a 2D fighting game before.</p>

  <p>If you’re into games that challenge your reflexes and make you laugh out loud while getting wrecked, <strong>Bloody Bastards</strong> is absolutely worth your time. Also, I’ve added the official trailer of Bloody Bastards to this website — go check it out if you want a quick glimpse into the madness!</p>

  <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

  <p>I also recommend checking out this video if you're interested in the creative possibilities within indie games like <strong>Bloody Bastards</strong>. The video shows how you can customize your character to look like the <em>Prince of Persia</em> — complete with themed clothing, swords, and a whole aesthetic that gives off serious nostalgic vibes.</p>

  <p>It’s a great example of how the game’s insane level of customization can let you express yourself or recreate legendary characters. You can mix and match armor, robes, gloves, and blades to build your own warrior — whether that’s a medieval brute or a noble Persian prince. And the best part is, you can still dive into battle and test your new look against waves of enemies.</p>

  <p>There was a comment under that video that summed up my experience with the game pretty well:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "[...] Instead of being an insane grind that never ends, it gets straight to the point, gives you absolute mobility and freedom to explore and let you be a happier person and move on with your life once you complete it. Excellent work."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thanks for reading! What did you think of the game and the review? Have you tried customizing your character into a famous warrior or something completely unique? Or maybe you're a small indie developer working on something cool — feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
